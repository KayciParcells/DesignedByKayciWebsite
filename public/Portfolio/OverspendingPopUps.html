          <h2>The Request</h2>
          <p>
            A Project Manager added me onto their project, asking that I help them implement a solution that would give their ecommerce customers the ability to allow overspending on their Purchase Orders in an easy and intuitive manner. In our initial discussion of the ask, we knew we would be making changes to the "Add New Purchase Order" pop-up and the checkout page, but further analysis of the application also led us to realize that a change on the "Manage Purchase Order" pop-up would also be needed.

          <h2>Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Before beginning any design work, I pulled up Hotjar heatmaps for both pop-ups. From this I was able to find a few helpful insights. On the "Add New Purchase Order" pop-up it was clear that there wasn't nearly as much interaction on the right side of the pop-up as the left (for both move and click data). This led me to believe that the address field didn't often need to be changed away from the default primary address, but was inconclusive on if customers were overlooking the one radio button question on that side or if they didn't need to change it from it's default "no" very often. Finally, on the "Manage Purchase Order" pop-up it was very clear that customers were frequently clicking on locked down fields (such as the one for PO Name and number) in addition to the fields that were editable. In short, these insights led me to suggest design and layout changes based on the data gathered. Additionally, from speaking with the requesters, I was able to lay out the expected functionality of the pop-ups based on the decisions of the customer, since we knew we only wanted to show the field to allow overspending when it was applicable.

          <h2>MVP Proposal</h2>
          <p>
            Once the logic of the field was determined and the results of heatmap analysis were available, I was able to look into how we could add this feature and make a few improvements in the process. Firstly, I determined that a checkbox would be the best input option and following best practices, it should be labled with positive verbage ("allow overspending") versus negative verbage ("do not allow overspending") due to the cognitive complexities of the negative language essentially creating a double negative when unchecked. Also, from the Hotjar findings, it made sense to align all fields to the left and also utilize top labels to decrease eye movement. In order to make the fields even more aligned, I suggested we change the one yes/no radio button question that had been on the right, into a checkbox that we could put with the other fields on the left. I had also checked with the requesters and developers to see if there had been a design reason for that one question being added on the right, but learned it was just an easy place for a developer to add it when they had been asked to add it previously. This also made it so that question remained visible at all times because during my analysis, I noticed if a user went to select "change" under Billing Address, then that question was covered up and unable to be answered/changed again. Although I saw many UX issues with the Billing Address section, I did not address those issues with the MVP to add in this feature since Hotjar heatmaps had suggested that it was a significantly lesser touched area. Therefore, we decided to prioritize the changes that impacted the majority of our customers first and were also lower in effort.
