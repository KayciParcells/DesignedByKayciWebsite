        <h2>The Request</h2>
        <p>
          This request is significantly different than my typical workflow, but does show abilities to compromise and creative problem solving. The key stakeholder on this request had quite a bit of clout in the company and was fairly fixated on ensuring our registration form had as few fields as possible and wanted to ensure the page length was short. I did try to explain to this individual that those are great baseline principles to guide decision making, but they are also situational and cannot always be applied to everything without other considerations. In addition to helping guide this stakeholder, I was pulled in by members of the review committee to offer guidance on how we could modernize the page and ensure changes still aligned with best practices.

        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
          After discussing the request with stakeholders and reviewing competitor registration pages, I created a quick wireframe to discuss a direction in which we could take the page. In making the wireframe, I also reviewed data provided from our customer experience expert which led me away from considering a multi-page registration form as an option. The stakeholders agreed with the narrower column width and ease of transition to mobile. This wireframe led to feedback on the label style and more discussion and compromise led to a solution everyone was happy with. In short, we were able to iron out a lot of details early on through discussions, competitor reviews, and wireframe discussions that made final design creation go smoothly.

        <h2>The Label</h2>
        <p>
          Before this update, our registration page had contained input fields with labels on the left. This created a high level of cognitive friction and lots of eye movement in order to fill out the form. In discussing the wireframe with stakeholders, I suggested top labels in order to align with the design system of application this form led to and to make it easier to read and fill out the form. This was rejected by our key stakeholder because it conflicted with their goal to "make the page as short as possible". Therefore, as a compromise, I proposed placeholder labels that move to the top once a user has started typing.

        <h2>Mobile View</h2>
        <p>
          Another consideration for designing the new registration page in the manner that I did, was for it's ease of transitioning to mobile view. The previous page design was considerably harder to use on a mobile device because the left-aligned labels did not align properly on mobile view and therefore made it difficult for a user to understand which label went with which field. By creating a narrower column width on desktop, the moble experience could be nearly identical and mobile users would have an equal experience to desktop users.

        <h2>Tooltip Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          I had previously worked a request to add in a dynamic listing of password requirements to help customers better understand what they needed in order to create their password. In attempt to "shorten the page" it was asked that this feature be removed. Knowing the research behind how that change had improved our customers experience and decreased the error rate for that field, I knew this wasn't an option. In order to appease all parties, I suggested we move the information into a tooltip that was only open when the customer was typing in the password field. I also spent extra time with the developer to ensure that no matter the screen size a customer could still click to the next field when the tooltip was open.
