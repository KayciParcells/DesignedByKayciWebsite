          <h2>The Request</h2>
          <p>
            I was pulled onto this project as an attempt to recover work that a third party had done to redesign the public website in Wordpress. Leadership asked if I could keep the elements they liked from the redesign, but revamp and tweak other elements to make the site better align with brand guidelines, accessiblility standards, and have a more professional look and feel. 
          </p>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">
            Due to this being an ongoing project, I have only added in elements that I have worked on that have been implemented in the existing site today and cannot show final completed designs for this project

          <h2>Making Brand Guidelines for the Web</h2>
          <p>
            One of the goals of pulling me into this project was to get the company to begin considering how they can start moving toward meeting ADA standards on their public website. After a basic review of the site created by the third party, I was able to conclude that an easy first step towards ADA compliance and creating clear UI guidelines would be to first focus on definining colors and fonts.
          </p>
          <h3>Reviewing Fonts</h3>
          <p>
            Upon review of our fonts, I noticed we were using display font, Px Grotesk, for all font sizes from H1 to body and that the heading hierarchy (H1-H4) was inconsistent from page to page. After analyzing the general text structure throughout the site, I made minor tweaks to font size and weight and created a defined hierarchy to use on all pages. This then allowed our content manager to review all the pages and ensure each page utilized heading tags properly and see that the styling remained consistent. Additionally, I discussed with our marketing team how we needed to establish some adjustments to our brand guidelines for web compared to print and how having a clean sans-serif as a body font would help with readability at the smaller font sizes. I proposed Noto Sans for it's ability to pair nicely with Px Grotesk along with it's multilingual capabilities since the company does business globally.
          </p>
          <h3>Reviewing Colors</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the website, colored backgrounds with white text was being utilized, but the web colors were just missing the ability to meet AA compliance. In collaboration with Marketing (who owned the brand guidelines), we were able to make small adjustments to the color pallette to ensure we provided sufficent contrast in our layouts on the web (meeting AAA compliance in most areas). Additionally, since purple was the primary color being used throughout the site, we determined that having a tertiary purple (the lightest option) would be useful for small accenting items such as a hover color on dark backgrounds.

          <h2>Establishing Reusable Components</h2>
          <p>
            Our Wordpress developer and I collaborated on clearly defining our web brand guildlines and laying them out within an internal website that anyone at the company could go to in order to see our styles, reusable components, and Wordpress blocks for the web. This also helped any developer working on the site to be able to grab blocks and apply them to new pages and ensure that the layout and styling remained consistent throughout the site. As I reviewed the existing site and made updates, I was also very aware to try and reuse as many components as possible to achieve our goals and to keep the development effort managable.

          <h2>Making Reusable Blocks from Brand Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            An example of a Wordpress block that I added to our design system is shown above. This block pulls together multiple brand elements to create a cohesive and functional website piece. The wavy lines in the background are a brand graphical element that is used througout the site and marketing materials. Meanwhile, our light blue accent color is able to be utilized along with our thin-line iconography and a simple text hierarchy. This block was primarily created to solve an issue I noticed while reviewing our support plan pages. Through reviewing Hotjar heatmaps on mouse movement, I was able to see that customers could benefit from seeing plan details laid out in a format other than a comparison table (especially for the long tables). I proposed that in addition to having the tables, we add this block to the top of the page to allow the customer to view information on individual plans one at a time before analyzing the information in a comparison table.

          <h2>Align Header with Company Needs</h2>
          <p>
            The third party had designed a header that was used throughout the site that contained a banner image, H1, horizontal rule, and an H2, followed by a paragraph and CTA button. This also very closely aligned to the existing header on the existing public website. One thing I noticed while collaborating with the Marketing department was that they were always wanting to showcase new products, blogs, and resources and they produced a great deal of new items that applied to various parts of the business. Therefore, when reviewing the header design, I proposed we add a column for a featured item to allow them to promote materials and products and also offer us flexibility on other pages. For example, on service pages that are very content heavy, the featured item could be swapped out for an "On This Page" section of jump links that allow customers to quickly navigate the page.

          <h2>Aligning Information for the Customer</h2>
          <p>
            In talking with our Content Manager, I was able to learn that Technical Drawings and Data Sheets were two of our most important resource categories. Upon further review in Google Analytics, I was able to confirm that these documents were indeed frequently the most accessed resource we provided. Although we offered a resources section of our site and Technical Drawings and Data Sheets were frequently accessed from there, I noticed our current setup for adding related resources to product pages sometimes resulted in those resources getting hidden far within a carousel. In addition to revamping our resources set-up on product pages to make them easier to filter and navigate, I also took the approach of adding in the capability to put the resources closer to the information they relate to. For example, within Specifications on a product page, I adjusted the layout to allow for a column of boxes that could link to the Technical Drawings and Data Sheets for that same product. This layout was also added to other areas of the product pages like the Product Details pages where boxes could be added that linked out to support plans that were purchaseable for the product. This way the customer no longer has to go searching to find the information that directly related to the information they are reading.
